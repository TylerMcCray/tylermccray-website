  company = "Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis: Teri Belecky-Adams Laboratory"
  company_url = ""
  location = "Indianapolis, IN"
  date_start = "2014-08-01"
  date_end = "2015-05-10"
  description = """The Belecky-Adams lab focuses on understanding the roles of the TGF-Beta family of growth factors, such as BMP7, in retinal development and damage via glial cells particularly retina-specific Muller glia. Tyler assisted in testing the hypothesis that the activation of Muller glia triggered by BMP7 is mediated through other retinal cells, like microglia, as a consequence of their inflammatory signaling and is required for a proper response. This work fostered his interest in the CNS and appreciation for the impact and fine balance glial cells maintain on both proper and dysfunctional development and health."""

  company = "Stark Neurosciences Research Institute: Bruce Lamb Laboratory"

  location = "Indianapolis, IN"
  date_start = "2016-08-01"
  date_end = "2018-08-20"
  description = """Primary focuses of the Lamb lab include: neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's Disease and traumatic brain injury with a specific interest in neuronal-glial communication in the development and progression of dementia. While there, Tyler aided in the investigation into the role of the microglial receptor TREM2, a master immune regulator, on tau pathology and neuronal stress kinases in a humanized tau mouse model resulting in a co-author publication in _Molecular Neurodegeneration_. During this time, he had the opportunity to begin exploring peripheral immune inputs mediated by TREM2 in aging and in tauopathies laying the groundwork for his ongoing PhD research."""

  description = """Tyler is in the process of working towards a PhD in Medical Neuroscience at the IU School of Medicine under the mentorship of Dr. Bruce Lamb. His main project is a natural continuation of prior work in peripheral immune interactions with the glia of the CNS in tauopathies that has expanded into the outcomes this input has on white matter pathology and vascular deficits, primarily those modulated by TREM2 in a disease progression- and context-dependent manner. Recent secondary projects include the effect of traumatic brain injury on inflammatory profiles and tau aggregation, with respect to age and other coincident pathologies, as a modifier in development of dementia."""
